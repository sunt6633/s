# Changelog

## [v2.4.0] — 2026-06-08

### Credits
- #50 by @robbyczgw-cla — in-process `web_search_plus`/`web_extract_plus` execution and parallel research mode.
- #46 by @robbyczgw-cla — Hermes profile `.env` loading for provider keys.
- #49 by @wysie — plugin update instructions in the README.

### ⚡ Performance
- The Hermes plugin now runs `web_search_plus` and `web_extract_plus` in-process by default instead of spawning a `search.py` subprocess per call, removing interpreter-startup, module re-import, and JSON round-trip overhead on every tool invocation. The legacy subprocess path remains as an automatic fallback (used if the in-process import fails) and can be forced with `WSP_FORCE_SUBPROCESS=1`. A thread watchdog preserves the previous hard wall-clock timeout. (#50)
- Research mode now queries its providers concurrently instead of sequentially, so wall-clock cost tracks the slowest provider rather than the sum of all of them. Result ordering stays deterministic (preserved by submission order) and the time budget still gates which providers launch and whether extraction runs. (#50)

### 🐛 Fixed
- Standalone `search.py`, config helpers, and `setup.py status` now load provider keys from the active Hermes profile `.env` in addition to plugin-local legacy `.env` files, preventing false `missing_api_key` fallbacks when keys live in `~/.hermes/.env`. (#46)

### 📚 Docs
- Added README instructions for updating an installed plugin plus reload/reset notes. (#49, thanks @wysie)

### 🔧 Improved
- Provider retry backoff now adds bounded random jitter (`RETRY_JITTER_FRACTION`) so concurrent or repeated retries against a recovering provider no longer synchronize into bursts. (#50)
- Provider health read-modify-write is now guarded by a lock so concurrent in-process provider calls (parallel research mode) cannot lose cooldown updates. (#50)

### 🧱 Internal
- Split `search.py`'s monolithic `main()` into `build_parser()`, the pure `execute_search_request()` pipeline (returns `(payload, exit_code)` without printing or `sys.exit`), and in-process `run_search_request()`/`run_extract_request()` entry points. CLI behaviour and output are unchanged. (#50)

### 🧪 Tests
- Added in-process search coverage (provider config resolution, auto-routing, explicit-provider error dicts, empty-query guard), research-mode out-of-order completion ordering, retry jitter bounds, and subprocess-fallback behaviour. (#46, #50)

## [v2.3.1] — 2026-05-31

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed Hermes plugin loading by using package-relative provider registry imports with direct-import fallback compatibility.

## [v2.3.0] — 2026-05-29

### ✨ Added
- Added the ProviderSpec registry as the central source of truth for provider metadata across setup, config, routing, extraction, doctor diagnostics, and CLI choices.

### 🔧 Improved
- Quality reports now expose transparent authority signals for canonical-source routing classes, including canonical domain hits, demoted domain hits, and whether the top result is a primary source.

### 📚 Docs
- Documented the `search.py` compatibility-shim policy and removal path for the monolith-to-module split.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added offline golden snapshot quality checks for canonical source presence, blocked mirror domains, duplicate counts, and extracted-content substance without live provider calls.
- Added registry drift coverage so provider metadata stays synchronized across public surfaces.

## [v2.2.1] — 2026-05-25

### 🔧 Changed
- Split the large `search.py` implementation into focused cache, config, HTTP client, provider-health, provider, quality, research, routing, and extraction modules while keeping the public Hermes tool surface backward-compatible.
- Routed provider search/extraction calls through the new module boundaries without changing configured provider behavior.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added provider/extract contract tests plus HTTP client module coverage to lock the refactor down.
- Verified the full plugin test suite after syncing the refactor stack.

## [v2.2.0] — 2026-05-19

### ✨ Added
- Added Parallel as the 13th search provider and 6th extraction provider using `PARALLEL_API_KEY`. Parallel is available for explicit calls and remains guarded from auto-routing by default via `auto_allow=false`.

### 🔧 Changed
- `web_extract_plus(provider="auto")` now uses the benchmark-backed extraction fallback order Tavily → Exa → Linkup → Parallel → Firecrawl → You.com. Tavily becomes the fast reliable default head; Parallel provides a fast excerpt-rich docs fallback; Firecrawl remains the robust scraper safety net rather than the first call.
- Updated provider onboarding metadata and setup priority examples to include Parallel.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added regression coverage for Parallel search normalization, extraction normalization, explicit-only routing, onboarding metadata, and extraction fallback behavior.

## [v2.1.0] — 2026-05-16

### 🔥 Removed
- Removed `web_answer_plus` from the registered Hermes tool surface and plugin manifest. The plugin now keeps one job: search plus extraction, without a separate answer-synthesis layer.
- Removed runtime answer-mode metadata (`answer_mode_recommended`) and onboarding answer capability reporting.

### 📚 Docs
- Updated README, User Guide, FAQ, Architecture, and plugin manifest to describe the two-tool surface: `web_search_plus` and `web_extract_plus`.

## [v2.0.0] — 2026-05-15

### 🚀 Major: Routing v2
- Replaced naive provider-priority auto-routing with benchmarked, class-aware Routing v2 based on the 25-query provider matrix and qualitative provider review.
- You.com, Serper, Exa, Firecrawl, Tavily, and Linkup now form the conservative default search pool.
- Brave, SerpBase, Querit, Parallel, native Perplexity, and Kilo Perplexity default to explicit/guarded use via `auto_allow=false`; existing configs inherit these guarded defaults unless users explicitly opt providers back in.
- Added class-aware routing boosts for multilingual current queries, AT/local shopping, GitHub/docs, package/API docs, arXiv/academic queries, Reddit/community searches, CVE/security advisories, official/regulatory queries, finance/IR, weather/local factual lookups, OSS discovery, and answer/synthesis prompts.
- Search auto-routing now flags answer/synthesis prompts with `answer_mode_recommended` instead of selecting slow answer-only providers such as Kilo Perplexity.
- Routing diagnostics now expose `language_hint`, `routing_class`, and `routing_policy`.

### 📚 Docs
- Updated README, User Guide, FAQ, and Architecture docs for Routing v2 defaults, guarded providers, setup presets, and migration behavior.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added Routing v2 regression coverage for default auto-allow gates, legacy auto-allow migration, multilingual Japanese/Arabic routing to You.com, arXiv routing to Exa, Reddit/site queries away from Exa, Reddit-company finance queries, CVE/security routing away from Firecrawl, answer-mode recommendations, and sports-table false positives.

## [v1.10.0] — 2026-05-15

### ✨ Added
- Added SerpBase as a search provider using `SERPBASE_API_KEY`, available via `provider="serpbase"`.
- Added onboarding/config support for `auto_allow`, including `setup.py config set-auto-allow <provider> on|off` so experimental or fallback providers can remain explicit-only.

### 🔧 Changed
- SerpBase defaults to `auto_allow=false`: configured keys unlock explicit calls, but auto-routing/fallback will not select it unless users opt in. See [Architecture: Auto-allow gate](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#auto-allow-gate).
- README provider, API-key, and routing docs now cover SerpBase activation and auto-allow behavior.
- Added detailed user documentation, FAQ, and architecture/trust-boundary docs under `docs/`.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added regression coverage for SerpBase response normalization, explicit provider calls, missing-key handling, onboarding metadata, and auto-routing exclusion.

## [v1.9.3] — 2026-05-14

### 🐛 Fixed
- `perplexity` now uses the native Perplexity API endpoint (`https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions`), `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, and `sonar-pro` model instead of the Kilo gateway defaults.
- `kilo-perplexity` is preserved as a distinct routing provider using `KILOCODE_API_KEY`, the Kilo gateway endpoint, and `perplexity/sonar-pro`.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added regression coverage for native Perplexity defaults, distinct Kilo Perplexity routing, separate environment keys, and onboarding/runtime config normalization.

## [v1.9.2] — 2026-05-10

### 🔧 Changed
- `web_extract_plus(provider="auto")` now documents and tests the intended extraction fallback order: Firecrawl → Linkup → Exa → Tavily → You.com. Firecrawl remains the robust default scraper, Linkup stays the cheap/citation-friendly fallback, and Exa is tried before Tavily for research-style pages.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added regression coverage for the direct extraction provider priority and Exa-before-Tavily fallback behavior.

## [v1.9.1] — 2026-05-09

### 🐛 Fixed
- Accept both `kilo-perplexity` and `kilo_perplexity` as routing aliases for the Perplexity/Kilo bridge in setup and runtime config loading.
- Prevent same-second config quarantine/backup filename collisions from overwriting earlier broken-config artifacts.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added regression coverage for underscore Kilo/Perplexity aliases and repeated same-second runtime config quarantines.
- Verified the full onboarding/config surface with isolated CLI smoke tests and runtime semantic checks.

### 🙏 Contributors
- @robbyczgw-cla

## [v1.9.0] — 2026-05-09

### ✨ Added
- Added provider-behavior onboarding commands under `setup.py config` so users can choose fixed-provider mode, re-enable auto-routing, set routing priority, set fallback provider, disable/enable providers, tune confidence threshold, and reset config with backup.
- Added JSON status output that reports configured provider capabilities plus routing preferences without printing secrets.
- Added `--config-path` and `WEB_SEARCH_PLUS_CONFIG` support for isolated tests and non-default behavior config locations.
- Added setup-time routing flags (`--routing`, `--default-provider`, `--provider-priority`, `--disable-providers`, `--fallback-provider`, `--confidence-threshold`) so first-run onboarding can configure keys and preferences together.

### 🔧 Improved
- `--provider auto` now respects persisted fixed-provider mode when auto-routing is disabled.
- Corrupt behavior config files are moved aside safely and replaced with defaults instead of crashing onboarding.
- Routing config writes are atomic; reset creates timestamped backups.

### 🧪 Tests
- Expanded onboarding coverage to 40 tests, including config commands, dry-runs, corrupt config recovery in both setup and runtime paths, no-secret leak checks, fixed-provider routing behavior, and Kilo/Perplexity alias normalization.

## [v1.8.1] — 2026-05-09

### 🔧 Changed
- Reframed `web_answer_plus` as an **optional beta answer-synthesis layer**, not a default replacement for `web_search_plus`.
- Tightened the registered tool description so agents prefer `web_search_plus` for current events, sports lineups, schedules, scores, standings, prices, weather, and raw source discovery.
- Changed the default `web_answer_plus` freshness behavior from `auto` to `none`. Set `freshness="auto"`, `day`, `week`, `month`, or `year` explicitly when recency should shape source selection.

### 📚 Docs
- Added clear “use `web_search_plus` first” guidance for fast/current/source-discovery queries.
- Added `web_answer_plus` beta guidance, pros/cons, and a dogfooded failure case around Austrian football lineup/current-query drift.
- Updated README examples to show answer synthesis as opt-in and freshness as explicit.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added regression coverage proving default `web_answer_plus` calls do **not** apply a freshness filter.
- Test suite: 82/82 unit tests passing locally.

## [v1.8.0] — 2026-05-09

### ✨ Added
- **`web_answer_plus`** — a new answer-first Hermes tool. It searches the web, selects useful sources, extracts the best pages when possible, and returns a concise answer with citations, warnings, freshness, confidence, and bounded-cost metadata.
- **Standalone provider setup** — `setup.py` now gives users a secret-safe way to inspect and configure provider keys without waiting for Hermes core plugin-CLI support.
- **Provider setup presets** — default setup walks through every supported provider; optional presets keep quick starts short (`starter`, `lean`, `search`, `extract`, `all`).
- **One-shot onboarding hint** — users with no configured provider keys get a single helpful setup hint instead of a dead tool surface.
- **README hero and release docs** — refreshed public documentation around the three main jobs: search, answer, and extract.

### 🔧 Improved
- Provider keys are now explained by capability, not as one fake “required key” list:
  - search-capable keys unlock `web_search_plus` and snippet-backed `web_answer_plus`;
  - extraction-capable keys unlock `web_extract_plus` and fuller cited answers.
- `web_answer_plus` keeps defaults cheap and predictable: quick mode uses 3 sources and up to 2 extracts; deep mode broadens search but still caps extraction at 5 URLs.
- Linkup is preferred for answer extraction, but it is not a hard dependency. If another extraction provider is configured, the normal extraction fallback path can still be used.
- If no extraction provider exists, `web_answer_plus` returns snippet-backed answers with an explicit warning instead of pretending it has full source text.
- Setup now respects `--env-path` consistently for both the dashboard and writes, preserving existing `.env` entries and never printing entered secret values.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added regression coverage for answer defaults, freshness detection, citation normalization, locale hints, output shapes, quick/deep mode selection, fallback extractor cost metadata, extraction status, cost guards, provider catalog, full-provider default setup, optional presets, target-env dashboard behavior, dry-run setup behavior, empty-key tool gating, and onboarding hints.
- Test suite: 81/81 unit tests passing locally.

## [v1.7.1] — 2026-05-06

### 🐛 Fixed
- Brave Search no longer fails on gzip-compressed API responses returned by `urllib.request.urlopen()`.
- Shared HTTP response parsing now handles `gzip`/`x-gzip`, gzip magic bytes, and `deflate` bodies for both GET and POST provider requests, including HTTP error bodies.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added regression coverage for gzip/deflate response decoding and Brave GET parsing through the shared urllib client.

## [v1.7.0] — 2026-05-03

### ✨ Added
- **Quality reports** for `web_search_plus` — optional diagnostics covering routing decisions, provider behavior, result counts, and quality metadata.
- **Research mode** — opt-in `mode="research"` path for multi-provider discovery plus selected URL extraction.
- **Golden query evaluator** — repeatable evaluation script and tests for tracking provider/research behavior over representative queries.

### 🔧 Improved
- Research mode now has a best-effort `research_time_budget` defaulting to 55 seconds, exposed through the Hermes tool schema and CLI as `--research-time-budget`.
- Extraction failures no longer fail the entire research response; partial search results are preserved and errors are reported in routing metadata.
- Budget exhaustion now skips remaining provider/extraction work instead of hanging or spending API calls blindly.
- Plugin metadata now matches the shipped tool surface: search, extraction, quality reports, and research mode.

### 🧰 Maintenance
- Added `requirements.txt` with bounded runtime dependencies.
- Added GitHub Actions CI for Ruff, pytest, and Python compile checks.
- Synchronized README, manifest, module headers, and CLI docs for the v1.7.0 release.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added regression coverage for research-mode extraction failures and time-budget exhaustion.
- Test suite: 47/47 unit tests passing.

### 🙏 Contributors
- Robby / **@robbyczgw-cla**

## [v1.6.1] — 2026-04-29

### 🔧 Improved
- **Shared retry path for provider execution** — extraction now uses the same transient-error retry behavior as search, reducing duplicated logic and making retry handling more predictable across providers.
- **Cooldown-aware extraction fallback** — `web_extract_plus` now skips providers already in cooldown and records those skips in routing metadata for clearer diagnostics.
- **Provider health reset on successful fallback** — successful extraction fallbacks now clear health state for the provider that ultimately succeeds.

### 🐛 Fixed
- Extraction fallback now records provider failure cooldown metadata when a provider exhausts retries and fails.
- Transient extraction failures (for example HTTP 503 / temporary upstream outages) now retry before failing over to the next provider.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added extraction tests for transient retry behavior, cooldown skipping, and provider health reset after fallback success.
- Test suite remains green: 35/35 unit tests passing.

### 🙏 Contributors
- Thanks **@Wysie** for the implementation behind this release (`refactor extract plus resilience reuse`, PR #7).

## [v1.6.0] — 2026-04-25

### ✨ Added
- **web_extract_plus** — companion tool to web_search_plus for URL content extraction via Firecrawl, Linkup, Tavily, Exa, and You.com. Unified result shape, per-URL error handling, automatic provider fallback. Use cases: clean markdown from a page, structured content for downstream LLM processing, multi-provider redundancy.
- New CLI flags: --extract-urls, --format html|markdown, --extract-images, --include-raw-html, --render-js
- Image extraction support — Firecrawl, Linkup, and Tavily can return image metadata via include_images=True

### 🔧 Improved
- Auto-fallback now triggers when primary provider returns all-URL errors (previously stopped at first non-empty results array)
- Response includes requested_provider field for transparency when fallback kicks in
- web_extract_plus only registers when an extraction-capable provider is configured (Firecrawl/Linkup/Tavily/Exa/You) — no more dead tool with search-only keys

### 🐛 Fixed
- Firecrawl include_images was a silent no-op; now parses markdown image syntax + ogImage metadata
- Invalid URLs (no http/https scheme) returned through the entire fallback chain unnecessarily; now return clean validation error
- Empty --extract-urls crashed argparse; now returns clean JSON error

### 🧪 Tests
- 9 → 15 unit tests; full coverage of new behavior (fallback cascade, check_fn scoping, image parsing, error paths)

### 🙏 Contributors
Thanks @Wysieie for the implementation.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Linkup provider** — source-grounded search with citations and fact-check signals. New regex dict `LINKUP_SOURCE_SIGNALS` (6 groups), bearer auth, parses both sourced-answer and standard search results.
- **Firecrawl provider** — web search with scrape-ready structured content. Scoring: `discovery_score + research_score * 0.35 + recency_score * 0.25`.
- Helper `load-env-file` supports plugin-local and legacy parent `.env` paths.

### Changed
- Provider priority order: tavily → linkup → querit → exa → firecrawl → perplexity → brave → serper → you → searxng.

### Credits
- Thanks @wysiecla for the contribution!

All notable changes to the Hermes web-search-plus plugin are documented here.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Brave Search provider** — new independent search index with generous free tier (2000 queries/month). Huge thanks to **@Wysie** for the full implementation (#4). Reduces reliance on Serper/Tavily and adds a strong fallback when Google-backed providers rate-limit.
- `BRAVE_API_KEY` env support + `.env.template` entry + README provider matrix update (also @Wysie)
- `tests/test_tie_breaker.py` — unit coverage for the SHA-256 deterministic tie-breaker (`_choose_tie_winner`): single-winner passthrough, same-query stability, distribution fairness across 200 queries, fallback without priority list

### Fixed
- Hermes `main` branch compatibility: plugin now survives the updated toolset resolution in Hermes core (thanks again **@Wysie**, #4)

### Contributors
- **@Wysie** — Brave provider + Hermes main compat (PR #4). Second merged PR from Wysie after the virtualenv docs fix in 1.3.1. Top external contributor 🏆

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- Plugin `.env` file now loads on module import, ensuring API keys are available at tool registration time (thanks @josh-clarke, #1)
- `plugin.yaml` metadata: corrected `requires_env` schema and Hermes repo link

### Added
- MIT license file
- README: Quick Start section, routing transparency, adaptive fallback explanation
- Docs: Hermes virtualenv setup clarification to prevent dependency-install-in-wrong-env footgun (thanks @Wysie, #3)

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- `time_range` parameter: filter results by recency (`day`, `week`, `month`, `year`)
- `include_domains` parameter: whitelist specific domains (e.g. `["arxiv.org"]`)
- `exclude_domains` parameter: blacklist specific domains (e.g. `["reddit.com"]`)
- `you` added to provider enum (was missing from schema)
- Feature parity table in README

### Changed
- Timeout increased from 65s to **75s** (aligned with OpenClaw plugin)
- README: install guide, full parameter table, examples, architecture, feature parity table

### Notes
- Now fully feature-parity with [OpenClaw web-search-plus-plugin](https://github.com/robbyczgw-cla/web-search-plus-plugin) main branch

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- `depth` parameter for Exa deep research modes:
  - `deep`: multi-source synthesis (4-12s latency)
  - `deep-reasoning`: cross-document reasoning and analysis (12-50s latency)
- Timeout increased from 30s to 65s to support long-running deep-reasoning queries
- Full README with routing table, parameter docs, examples, architecture section
- CHANGELOG

### Fixed
- Handler now correctly unpacks input dict passed by Hermes registry
  (was causing "expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not dict" on all tool calls)
- `depth` parameter name aligned with OpenClaw plugin (was `exa_depth` in initial port)

### Notes
- Synced with [OpenClaw@908b145](https://github.com/robbyczgw-cla/web-search-plus-plugin/commit/908b14529230b1b300e44c6dd2cc8171833c1abb)

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Plugin handler dict-unpacking bug: Hermes registry passes full input dict as first
  positional argument, not keyword args. Added `isinstance(args_or_query, dict)` check.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- Initial Hermes plugin port of web-search-plus from OpenClaw TypeScript plugin
- Auto-routing across Serper, Tavily, Exa, Querit, Perplexity, SearXNG
- `provider` parameter to force a specific provider
- `count` parameter for result count (1-20)
- Hermes plugin registration via `register(ctx)` in `__init__.py`
